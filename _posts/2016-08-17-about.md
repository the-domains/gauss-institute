  Gauss Institute is a Foundation for New Technologies, Innovations, and
  Knowledge Transfer, established on 15 August 2006 in Bitola, Republic of
  Macedonia. Gauss Institute continues activities of previously active
  foundation Euro-regional Technology Center – Bitola, which was established by
  Faculty of Technical Sciences, University “St. Kliment Ohridski” – Bitola and
  Municipality Bitola with the support of the GTZ-Technology Transfer project.
  Euro-regional Technology Center should stop its operation because of legal
  restriction imposed by changes in the Law for Higher Education in the Republic
  of Macedonia, which introduced integrated university and restricts faculties
  to be founders of separate legal entities. The role of the establishment of
  the foundation is through development and application of new technologies,
  innovations, and knowledge transfer to contribute toward the establishment of
  a knowledge-based society in the region. A knowledge-based society is an
  innovative and life-long learning society, which possesses a community of
  scholars, researchers, engineers, technicians, research networks, and firms
  engaged in research and in the production of high-technology goods and service
  provision. It forms a national innovation-production system, which is
  integrated into international networks of knowledge production, diffusion,
  utilization, and protection. Its communication and information technological
  tools make vast amounts of human knowledge easily accessible. Knowledge is
  used to empower and enrich people culturally and materially, and to build an
  eco-friendly sustainable society.
